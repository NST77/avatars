So, basically, I kept coming across these ridiculous "initial orientated" avatar generators and thought it was stupid how they felt the need to generate and process an image (PNG) when the same thing could be done in a stupidly simple way (I spent more time on the documentation page) via outputting an SVG (over 98.71%~ of the users of the internet's browsers can handle - [ref caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=svg)) which also coincidentally (obviously not ü§≠) allowed requests to be processed far quicker. The creation of such has allowed me to offer a free API service for this process, too. Anyone may access this helpful tool whether testing or pushing to production and can do so [here](https://avatars.oxro.io).

If you're interested in developing this further or touching up the documentation style, feel free to do so and create a pull request üôè . Obviously the tiny generator script can be found in `generator.php` and the documentation page (along with it's CSS) in `index.html`.


You're welcome.
